# IT3-02: Landing Page Graphics

**Status:** DONE
**Depends on:** IT3-01
**Wave:** 1

## Scope

Add subtle background artwork to the landing page hero section:
- Mosaic artwork (MosaicImageSmall.jpg) as hero background
- Store image at `public/images/mosaic-bg.jpg`
- Apply with ~12% opacity + white/40 overlay for subtle texture
- Light and subtle mood, preserving dark text readability
- No aggressive graphics, maintains minimal aesthetic

## Files

## Completion Notes
