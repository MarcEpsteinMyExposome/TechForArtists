**Status:** PENDING
**Depends on:** All other IT2 tasks
**Wave:** 5

## Scope

Final verification and deployment:
1. `npm test` — all tests pass
2. `npm run build` — production build succeeds
3. `npm run lint` — no lint errors
4. Fix any issues found

No env vars needed. App is fully client-side (localStorage persistence).

## Acceptance

- Production build succeeds
- No lint errors
- App is accessible at Vercel URL
