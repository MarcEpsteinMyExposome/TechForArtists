# IT3-06: Setup Guide ("How to Use")

**Status:** PENDING
**Depends on:** IT3-01
**Wave:** 4

## Scope

Help users add their signature to their email client with clear, step-by-step instructions:
- Post-copy wizard triggered after "Copy Signature" succeeds
- Email client selection: Gmail (web), Outlook (web), Apple Mail, Other
- Gmail web: full numbered step-by-step instructions with screenshots or descriptions
- Other clients: friendly fallback message pointing to their app's signature settings
- UI: modal or slide-out panel on editor page
- Designed for non-technical users (artists), jargon-free language
- "Got it" or "Close" button to dismiss

## Files

**Create:** `components/editor/SetupGuide.tsx`, `components/editor/SetupGuideModal.tsx`
**Modify:** `app/editor/page.tsx` (show modal after successful copy)
