# IT3-04: Profile Image Upload

**Status:** PENDING
**Depends on:** IT3-03
**Wave:** 3

## Scope

Allow users to upload profile images (headshots or logos) to replace initials avatar:
- File upload from computer (not URL input — users are non-technical artists)
- Accept JPG/PNG via HTML file input
- Client-side image processing:
  - Resize using Canvas API to ~100-150px square
  - Compress as JPEG quality 85%
  - Convert to base64 data URL
- Store in signature's `imageUrl` field (existing schema already supports this)
- Works for both personal headshots and corporate logos
- "Remove" button to clear image and revert to initials avatar
- Entirely client-side, no server/storage needed

## Files

**Create:** `components/editor/ImageUpload.tsx`, `lib/utils/imageProcessing.ts`
**Modify:** `components/editor/SignatureForm.tsx` (add ImageUpload to Personal Info section)
**Tests:** `__tests__/lib/utils/imageProcessing.test.ts`, `__tests__/components/editor/ImageUpload.test.tsx`

## Acceptance

- File input accepts JPG/PNG only
- Image resized to ~100-150px and compressed client-side
- Base64 data URL stored in signature.imageUrl
- Preview shows uploaded image in signature
- "Remove" button clears imageUrl and shows initials avatar again
- Works in all signature layouts (horizontal, stacked, compact)
- Tests cover image processing and component behavior
