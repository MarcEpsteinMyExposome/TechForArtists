## Task Management Protocol

When completing a task:
1. Mark status as `DONE` in this file
2. Update the task file with completion notes
3. **Move task file to `.claude/tasks/archive/`**
4. Update `SESSION.md` with session notes
5. Update `CLAUDE.md` if features changed

Task specs live in `.claude/tasks/` (active) and `.claude/tasks/archive/` (completed).
